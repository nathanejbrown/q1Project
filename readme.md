# Nathan Dennis
### First Proposal

My project will be called Words, Words, Words

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1780805
https://github.com/nathanejbrown/q1Project
https://nathanejbrown.github.io/q1Project/

## What will it do?

It will allow you to input a word and get back information about synonyms and antonyms for that word. At that point, it will allow you to (optionally) enter your phone number and have the information texted to you.

## What problem will it solve?

This project will solve the problem of people writing painfully unintelligent sentences. "Avoid using the word ‘very’ because it’s lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don’t use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys - to woo women - and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do."

## Who has this problem?

This problem is woefully present amongst a staggering percentage of the population.

## How will your project solve this problem?

By allowing people to seek out and discover new words, which they can then use to better their paper/resume/project.

## What input does it need?

It will simply take a word as an input, and output synonym/antonym information for that word. It will have an optional field to have the information texted, which will require the user to input a phone number.

## What APIs will it use?

It will use the words.bighugelabs.com api to find information about the given word, and the textbelt.com api to send the user a text.

## What technologies will it use?

I will utilize JavaScript, CSS, HTML, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

## What additional features will it have?

Assuming I have time, I want to add a feature to allow a user to "Tribbiani-ify" a sentence. There's an episode of Friends wherein Chandler introduces Joey to the thesaurus feature on his computer and Joey uses it on every single word in his document. This feature would allow users to input a sentence, at which point the program would find a random synonym for every word (ignoring words like 'the', 'it', etc).

## Wireframe

I'll admit I didn't fully understand how this page worked, but this gets the general idea across.
